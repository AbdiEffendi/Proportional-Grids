# Proportional Grids

Don’t think widths, think proportions. A dead simple method of creating responsive fluid grids with fixed gutters. Use classes to set the proportions you want your columns to take at which breakpoint.

Supports nested grids and requires no class="first" or :first-child nonsense. Even works in IE7 and below

# Proportional Grids

Don't think widths, think proportions. A dead simple method of creating responsive fluid grids with fixed gutters. Use classes to set the proportions you want your grid to take at which breakpoint.

Supports nested grids and requires no `class="first"` or `:first-child` nonsense. Even works in IE7
